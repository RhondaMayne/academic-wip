# R. Mayne, *Mapping Choreographed Communities: Feminist Movement and Digital Approaches to Virginia Woolf*

## Overview
In my current research, I explore how choreographic structures in Virginia Woolf’s writing – scenes of dance, collective gesture, rhythmic convergence, and embodied attunement – generate alternative forms of feminist community. Across *The Years*, *Three Guineas*, and *Between the Acts*, Woolf repeatedly imagines political possibility not through institutional authority but through constellations of women moving in relation to one another. These moments suggest forms of nonhierarchical, nonviolent collectivity that underpin her late political thinking.

## Embodied Movement and Social Form
What interests me is how Woolf turns to embodied movement as a way of imagining social forms that disrupt the hierarchical structures she critiques. For instance, Sara and Maggie Pargiter’s spontaneous dance in *The Years*, the defiant collective presence of women invoked throughout *Three Guineas*, and the shifting, loosely choreographed interactions among the pageant actors in *Between the Acts* all create temporary, relational communities shaped as much by gesture and rhythm as by language or ideology. Some of these movements are overtly political, others subtle or incidental, yet all participate in Woolf’s broader inquiry into how bodies move, assemble, and gesture, producing forms of relational meaning that trouble hierarchical structures.

## Digital Approaches
Building on this conceptual foundation, I am interested in exploring how digital humanities tools such as network visualisation, layered annotation, and AI-assisted analysis might help illuminate or spatialise these relational formations. My research interest lies in how these approaches might support new ways of reading Woolf’s choreography of dance, rhythm, and gesture: not necessarily by quantifying the texts, but by opening alternate perspectives on patterns of movement, proximity, and collective attention (understood here as the relational focus that emerges when bodies assemble or respond in concert). These digital possibilities function as catalysts for interpretation: tools that might reveal structures of connection, movement, and feminist community formation that are otherwise dispersed across the prose.

## Potential Collaborative Directions
Depending on the direction of collaboration, the project might integrate relational maps of choreographic or collective scenes, annotated digital passages tracing gestures and proximities, an XR environment that experiments with the spatial dimensions of Woolf’s choreographies, or exploratory H/AI models that visualise patterns of movement or feminist convergence. (These possibilities are intentionally open, indicating potential directions the project might take rather than committing it to any fixed methodology.)

## Contribution
This project brings modernist studies, feminist theory, embodiment, and digital approaches into dialogue. It proposes that movement in Woolf, whether overt or subtle, offers a way of understanding how she imagines collective life formed through relation rather than structured by hierarchy. By considering how DH and H/AI methods might help visualise or conceptualise these dynamics, the project opens new pathways for reading Woolf’s attentiveness to bodies, rhythms, and communal possibility.
